# wordled (for younger users)
A Wordle based game made in Javascript

Unlike the original, Wordled produces a random 5 letter word with
each play. With 100 simple words to choose from, your youngster can
play for hours on end.

This branch contains a separate [answers list](assets/js/answers.js)
with words suitable for younger users with a more limited vocabulary.
To create your own list, just edit assets/js/answers.js.

**No installation required**

Wordled can be played in the browser, simply open the index.html file in any browser to play
